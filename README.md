This template is a sample LaTeX document designed for both M.S. and Ph.D. dissertations of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Seoul National University.

Please read through the following instructions before working with this template:\
(1) The "phd_sample.tex" file serves as the main document. Work on this .tex file for your dissertation.\
(2) The default reference style follows the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Author-Date references.\
For specifics, refer to the document in the following link: https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/9780784478998.ch17.<br/>
(3) The title page is not automatically built from the "phd_sample.tex" file. Utilize the "snu_cee_dissertation_title_190x260.docx" file to build the title page.\
(4) You will have to modify the specifics of your documents, including page size, chapter & subchapter title style, etc. in the "snuthesis_utf8_eng.cls" file.
Please feel free to modify them accordingly.\
